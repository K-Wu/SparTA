## Overview
This branch is for the Mlsys'22 artifact evaluation of paper "EFFICIENT GPU KERNELS FOR N:M-SPARSE WEIGHTS IN DEEP LEARNING". 


## Evaluation Setup
* Artifacts Available:
The source code of Sparta is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/SparTA

* Artifacts Functional:
Documentation: the following document includes detailed guidelines on how to build, install, test NMSparse and the experiments to compare with other baselines.



## Environment setup
First, git clone the source code.
```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/SparTA
cd nni && git checkout nmsparse_artifact
```
To make the reproducing easier, we provide a docker image that contains all dependencies and baselines. Build the docker image:
```
cd image
sudo docker build . -t artifact
```
Third, start a docker instance
```
sudo docker run -it --gpus all --shm-size 16G artifact
```
Following commands are executed in the docker.
First we also need get the source code and initialize the environment
```
Run Baselines:
cd src/baseline
bash run.sh

Run NMSparse:
bash run.sh
```
